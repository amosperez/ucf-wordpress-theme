# UCF Wordpress Theme


### Project Description

This project is my attempt at redesigning the UCF Office of Student Involvement website and creating a custom WordPress theme. The primary objective was to familiarize myself with the Athena Framework, developed by the University of Central Florida (UCF), and to apply it in a practical project.

### Features
- Athena Framework: Utilized the Athena Framework for its robust and flexible design components.
- Custom WordPress Theme: Developed a custom WordPress theme to mirror the structure and design of the OSI website (https://osi.ucf.edu).
- Responsive Design: Ensured the theme is responsive and works well on various devices.

### Status
The project is currently unfinished. I began this project as part of my preparation for a job interview with the OSI Design Group, but I was not hired. However, the project demonstrates the initial steps and thought process involved in theme development using the Athena Framework.
